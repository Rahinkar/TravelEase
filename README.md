# TravelEase

Developed a dynamic and user-friendly Tourism and Resort Booking Website TravelEase. It is an innovative web
and mobile app for booking villas and farmhouses, providing a seamless, budget-friendly experience. It offers
personalized services, chef and cooking options, and local attraction information, catering to luxury travelers
seeking customizable stays, and will also enhance the overall booking experience. The platform supports secure
booking, payment processing, user management, and real-time notifications, and user reviews, built on a robust
architecture with React.js, Java with Springboot, and MySQL. Future expansions will include additional local
services and global offerings to further enhance the luxury accommodation experience. The goal is to create an
intuitive platform that simplifies the booking process for users while providing powerful tools for administrators.
